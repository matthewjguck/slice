Slice is a simple image slicing tool for seperating a larger image into smaller, seamlessly cropped ones. Slice is an easy way to create engaging instagram carousels or separate high aspect ratio images for increased viewability.

# How to use:
Simply upload an image, specify how many slices you want, and click "Slice!"
